<p> Simply meaning 'Korean clothes', 'hanbok' was introduced in the late 19th century by Koreans as a term to help differentiate their everyday dress from a recent influx of western-style clothing. A century later, western clothing had overtaken hanbok as the main style of dress worn by Koreans. In turn, hanbok became regarded as more of a ceremonial dress reserved for traditional holiday celebrations and events, such as first birthdays, weddings, and funerals. Hanbok, in the public's eye, had become less approachable and more formal.<p>
