<p>Possibly South Korea’s most famous landmark, Gyeongbokgung Palace is the largest of five residences of the Joseon Dynasty found in Seoul. It was built in 1395 but destroyed by fire during the Imjin War in the 1590s. Sadly, the Palace was left abandoned for centuries until restoration work began during the reign of King Gojong (1852-1919).Gyeongbokgung Palace is now a collection of museums and historical sites surrounded by gardens and ancient stone pagodas. The Changing of the Guard ceremony takes place on the hour between the hours of 10am and 3pm. This is a visual feast of the senses and has been performed since the 14th century. Many day tours of Seoul will visit Gyeongbokgung Palace.<p>

<p>Rising up from the depths of the Korean Peninsula as Korea’s largest and southernmost island, Jeju’s serene, crater-marked landscape and mild sub-tropical climate is blessed with a natural beauty ideal for hikers and a new wave of wellness tourism.The island is known for its unique cuisine, most notably the local seafood caught by Jeju’s famous female deep-sea divers (haenyeo), all of whom are aged 60 and over. Jeju’s beaches are perfectly suited for some coastal relaxation, its idyllic waters cloaking vivid seascapes of coral. Further inland, you will find narrow lanes lined with traditional cottages rendered from the native black lava rock, while fertile volcanic soils support palm trees, flourishing mandarin groves, pineapples and exotic dragon fruit.</p>

<p>The sustainable secret of the Lotte World Tower, Seoul’s futuristic skyscraper, is hidden 200 meters below the sidewalks of the South Korean capital. At a depth that is well beyond that of the foundations charged with sustaining one of the tallest buildings in the world, there are 720 geothermal probes that feed six brine and water heat pumps, able to heat and cool the air inside the steel and crystal giant.The tower contains galleries, cafés, and a luxury hotel, in addition to a skywalk and an observation deck. It is one of the best spots to appreciate the breathtaking view of Seoul's vibrant city lights.<p>

<p>Mudeungsan UNESCO Global Geopark is located in the southern part of the Korean peninsula near the city of Gwangju and is centred around Mount Mudeung. This mountain towers high above the city and the surrounding lowlands (1,100 m) and lends the Geopark its name. Mudeungsan UNESCO Global Geopark covers an area of 1,051 km2 about half of which is covered with forest. The climate, influenced by the mountains, is warm and temperate with significant rainfall every month.  The core area (75 km2) lies within Mudeungsan National Park. Mt. Mudeung was formed by the Cretaceous volcanic activity about 87 million years ago. The Geopark features twenty geosites representing seven geological periods.<p>
