<p>During the colonial period, the Japanese pillaged Joseon’s resources, banned the use of the Korean language–even going so far in 1939 as to require Koreans to change their personal names to Japanese style surnames and given names under the Name Order, and conscripted Koreans into their work force or as uniformed soldiers in the Pacific War. Koreans engaged in persistent struggles to regain their independence. They organized numerous clandestine organizations to fight the Japanese within the country such as Joseon National Sovereignty Restoration Group and The Korea Liberation Corps. They also established forward bases for the independence movement in China, Russia, and the United States and led unprecedentedly peaceful demonstrations. In March 1919, Korean leaders announced the Declaration of Independence. Students and ordinary people staged street demonstrations across the country shouting their motto, “Long Live Korean Independence!” The movement spread to the Koreans resisting in Manchuria, the Maritime Provinces of Siberia, the United States, Europe, and even to Japan. Following the March 1st Movement, organizations representing Koreans were established in Seoul, the Maritime Province of Siberia, and Shanghai. Of these, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, which was established in Shanghai, China, is the country’s first democratic republican government; it was equipped with a modern Constitution and a political system that separated the three basic branches (executive, legislature and judicial) of government.<p>

<p>On May 10, 1948, the first general election was held in a democratic manner in South Korea under the UN’s supervision to elect the 198 members of the National Assembly. In July of the same year, the Constitution was enacted and Rhee Syngman and Yi Si-yeong, two independence fighters deeply respected by Koreans, were elected as the country’s first President and Vice President, respectively. On August 15, 1948, the Republic of Korea (ROK) was formally established as a liberal democracy, which inherited the legitimacy of the PGK. The UN recognized the government of the ROK as the only legitimate government on the Korean Peninsula.However, to the north of the 38th parallel, a general election under UN supervision could not be carried out due to the Soviet Union’s opposition.On September 9, 1948, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) was proclaimed as a communist country, and Kim Il-sung, who had served as an officer of the Soviet Russian Army, was sworn in as the President. Amid the confrontation between a free democracy in the south and a communist dictatorship in the north, the ROK government led by President Rhee Syngman was burdened with many issues such as establishing domestic order, eliminating vestiges of Japanese imperialism, and overcoming ideological confrontations between the left and the right.<p>
