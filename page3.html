<p>Bulgogi generally refers to thinly sliced beef marinated in a sauce that is a mix of soy sauce, sugar or honey, sesame oil, garlic, onion, and often pureed Asian pear. Many Korean home cooks tend to marinate the beef overnight and then grill or stir-fry it with sliced onions, scallions, mushrooms, and other vegetables. The South Korean millennial generation is unfamiliar with our country’s previous bulgogi craze; many bulgogi specialty restaurants have started to disappear as American fast food and casual dining restaurants have permeated the South Korean dining scene since the 1990s. It is also often stir-fried in a pan in home cooking. Sirloin and rib eye are frequently used cuts of beef for the dish. Bulgogi is a very popular dish in South Korea, where it can be found.<p>
